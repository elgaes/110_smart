What we need the b2r end result to look like:

We want a table X that looks like:
BIN_CODE
stkm_id 

Then we simply run an 
insert into impairment table, from impairment table where stkmid=[STKMID] AND BIN_CODE = [BIN_CODE] AND isType='b2r'


To build table X:
We run the same comparison, but we ignore FF
FF's might be present, but they will be wrapped in the BIN_CODE and transfered acordingly


To test B2R success with mergeAll.php:
STK1
SELECT DSTRCT_CODE, WHOUSE_ID, BIN_CODE, COUNT(*) AS recordCount, fingerprint 
FROM smartdb.sm18_impairment 
WHERE isType='b2r'  
AND isBackup IS NULL 
AND stkm_id=1
AND fingerprint IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DSTRCT_CODE, WHOUSE_ID, BIN_CODE, fingerprint
ORDER BY BIN_CODE

SKT2
SELECT DSTRCT_CODE, WHOUSE_ID, BIN_CODE, COUNT(*) AS recordCount, fingerprint 
FROM smartdb.sm18_impairment 
WHERE isType='b2r'  
AND isBackup IS NULL 
AND stkm_id=2
AND fingerprint IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DSTRCT_CODE, WHOUSE_ID, BIN_CODE, fingerprint
ORDER BY BIN_CODE
